              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>
                Web Solution International Network (WSIN) Global is a freelance
                consultant team, which has been operating their services
                worldwide since the year early January, 2020. As the team lead
                of this freelancer group, I am Md Jahedul Anwer, actively
                available to meet customer demand very actively and effectively.
                I have completed a Masters of Business Administration (MBA)
                degree with IT & e-business from Lansbridge University Canada
                and also completed a Masters of Science (MSc) degree from the
                University of Dhaka, with Zoology specialization on Fisheries.
                With over 34 years of engagement in both profitable and
                non-profitable sectors, I have worked for 24 years to implement
                non-profitable sector and humanitarian work projects and
                programs with different non-government national and
                international organizations in Bangladesh. I have also worked to
                implement agricultural interventions as an entrepreneur for 7
                years with great success. My technical knowledge spans across
                Agriculture, Aquaculture, Poultry & livestock, Environment, and
                biodiversity conservation. I also possess outstanding knowledge
                in different types of handicraft projects including Block,
                Batik, Fashion designing, Bamboo & Wooden crafts, and more. I am
                ready to launch new fashion designing and supply dresses as per
                work orders and customer demands from all over the world.
